# TesodevBEChallenge
This code is prepared to fullfill Tesodev's challenge requirements.
There are some things to improve
-Address supposed to be the child class of Customer and Order classes. This is impossible and meaningless so I changed it. Now Address is related to the customer and we can pass customers Address ID to any order any time.
-Order table should be reorganised but I kept it as original since it is not going to be a live project.
-A validate method is required to Customers but I did not get the point since we already validate our models.
